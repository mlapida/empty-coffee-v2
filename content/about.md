## Meta

Empty Coffee is built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generating framework. The starter theme used is [Atlantic](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-atlantic-theme) developed by [Zero Static](https://www.zerostatic.io). The site is currently hosted on [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), though I tend to move it around and experiment with other hosting platforms. This site leverages [CloudFlare Web Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) for privacy conscious analytics. If you're interested, you can view the source code for Empty Coffee on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlapida/empty-coffee-v2).
