## Meta

Empty Coffee is built with the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) static site generating framework. The starter theme used is [Gatsby Theme Minimal](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) developed by [Lennart](https://twitter.com/lekoarts_de).  The site is currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), though I tend to move it around and experiment with other hosting platforms. This site leverages [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/DT1NEH) for privacy conscious analytics. If you're interested, you can view the source code for Empty Coffee on [GitHub](https://github.com/mlapida/empty-coffee).
